# NET CORE - IMPORTANT LIBRARIES

![justmock__net_770](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54249736/116005282-f380f580-a60e-11eb-9e24-02ecc4f6bb74.png)

About nine different libraries were mentioned in this repository. These are the libraries that net core developer will definitely need as a professional. For example, how is data received from a client verified? How is the retrieved data mapped to asset classes? Apart from these, I used environment helpers on how to handle error events in the application.
With the Hangfire library, which is widely used in the industry, I coded how you can do your periodic transactions asynchronously. In addition, I have also touched on some important issues such as swagger, logging, ip restriction that you will need while developing a web api application. In short, I made it easier to access the important libraries we needed in the net core project by coding them in different branches.
